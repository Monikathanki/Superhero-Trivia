Project Requirements
While you're building your quiz app, you'll need to keep in mind what your app must do and how it should be built.

User experience requirements
The following requirements cover what the app must do, from the user's perspective.

The starting screen should have a button that users can click to start the quiz. [done]
Users should be prompted through a series of at least 5 multiple choice questions that they can answer. [done]
Users should be asked questions 1 after the other. [done]
Users should only be prompted with 1 question at a time. [done]
Users should not be able to skip questions. [done]
Users should also be able to see which question they're on (for instance, "7 out of 10") and their current score ("5 correct, 2 incorrect"). [done]
Upon submitting an answer, users should: receive textual feedback about their answer. If they were incorrect, they should be told the correct answer. be moved onto the next question (or interact with an element to move on). [done]
Users should be shown their overall score at the end of the quiz. In other words, how many questions they got right out of the total questions asked. [done]

Build App Process Framework

Next create function stubs with pseudocode in your JavaScript.
One by one, fully implement each function.
Add CSS styling last. Once your application is working, add CSS styling to make it look good.

Assignment Grading
Build a quiz app that meets the requirements described in the previous checkpoint. Use your wireframe and user stories as a guide.
Deploy your app on GitHub using GitHub pages. When you're done, please create a Gist with the a link to the live page and your repo, and submit it below.
As a reminder, your project will be scored based on this rubric. In order to pass, you must score an average of 3.5 points on each objective (21 total points) and cannot receive a 1 score for any objective.
